            <p class="committee-description">The Equity Research Committee analysts conduct in-depth analysis of publicly traded companies to provide investment recommendations. In a professional setting, this role provides support to fund managers, clients, and investors. In our organization, those in this committee evaluate financial data, modeling future performance, and assessing industry trends. Unlike most finance-focused teams, our ER committee also includes ESG adjustments into our assumption models, like DCFs, to take into account sustainable measures companies take to improve outlook. Through this, our financial calculations are driven not only by industry standard practices and constantly evolving methodologies, but by dimensions that lead to company stability and sustainability.
                Senior analysts who have refined market knowledge in the Equity Research committee get the opportunity to join the Macroeconomic Analysis team, where they are tasked with educational research responsibilities. The Macroeconomic Analysis team is tasked with creating weekly reports that highlight important economic events, breaking down key data points that are important to financial markets, and crafting meaningful insights on the health of the consumer and the overall state of the economy. By researching these topics in depth, Macro team members work to become subject matter experts to contribute to the improved accuracy of the financial projections that newer analysts create and to cultivate a more financially educated community internally at the Sustainable Investment Group.

            </div>
            <p class="committee-description">
The Sustainability Committee contributes to the qualitative evaluation process in stock analysis, focusing on considerations such as ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and other aspects of firms and industries that could influence market volatility and long-term stock potential. Sustainability analysts utilize resources like Refinitiv, Reuters, and Sustainalytics, on top of individual firms’ annual reports and sustainability reports to evaluate the extent to which the company adheres to state and federal ESG regulations and market sentiments, examining the returns in the long run from both the qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The sustainability committee conducts research on the potential ESG considerations, including but not limited to carbon emission, water usage, waste management, data privacy, DEI, risk management, and anti-corruption. The team also studies the policy changes such as the newly signed executive orders to analyze the possible influence on a firm’s profitability in the future. Senior analysts engage in long-term projects of interest, with a team focusing on utilizing ESG metrics in long-run predictions of an asset, standardization of ESG scoring, and development of a more comprehensive risk score (specifically ESG risks and reputational risks) that all could be incorporated into the evaluation of implied share pricing of an asset.

The Quantitative Analysis Committee analysts use statistical models and programming to support portfolio construction, risk management, and trade execution. This team focuses on developing and refining the quantitative engines that drive SIG investment decisions. In particular, the quantitative committee focuses on analyzing risk factors using regression models, validating our investment thesis using the expected market return, and so forth. 
Senior analysts work on long-term projects discovering market insights using existing statistical models, while new analysts learn the strategies and tools the industry utilizes. In addition, the quantitative analysts collaborate with our sustainability analysts to bridge quantitative and qualitative data results, including the sustainability lens in our investment process and reporting, transforming raw quantitative outputs—like carbon-intensity scores, ESG factor exposures, and climate-scenario stress tests—into clear, actionable insights that inform both investment decisions and sustainability disclosures. Through embedding sustainability considerations into core quantitative workflows, SIG ensures our quant models capture not just financial risks and returns, but also the evolving environmental and social factors that drive long-term value creation.

The Research and Development Committee is the team behind long-term innovation at the Sustainable Investment Group. R&D is the committee that turns the club’s big ideas into real projects that help grow both the club and our sustainable investment fund. Working at the intersection of research and execution, R&D’s process starts with studying financial theory, ESG research, and academic models. This helps build a strong foundation for ideas that are then brought to life through application of technical skills like programming, data analysis, and optimization. Combining knowledge from finance, economics, computer science, and environmental studies, this interdisciplinary approach helped develop SIG’s investment philosophy, which is based on the ESG-efficient frontier. This framework shows how investors can balance financial performance with ESG values and plays a key role in how we  think about responsible investing. R&D ensures that every strategy we support is backed by research, technology, and a long-term commitment to positive impact.            </p>

            <div class="why-sustainability-content">
                <p>Due to the fast-paced and constantly changing market, the ability of the firm to invest in long-term risk management (for ESG correlates with the firm's long-term resilience) is crucial; Thus, our organization takes into greater account this unique lens of sustainability in our equity research and quantitative analysis. By combining both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of an asset, we believe the long-term evaluation of a stock would be more comprehensive, minimizing the volatility of the portfolio.</p>

                <p>At the Sustainable Investment Group at UC San Diego, we approach investing with a dual focus: achieving strong financial returns while promoting a more sustainable and ethical future. ESG investing is central to our philosophy. We believe that how a company treats the planet, its people, and its stakeholders reveals a great deal about its long-term stability, reputation, and profitability.</p>
